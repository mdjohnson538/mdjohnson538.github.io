## About Me
I'm interested in the application of social and data science to real-world problems, particularly within the contexts of intimate partner & sexual violence, health and human service-related advocacy efforts, public opinion, and political representation.

## Projects
A handful of recent projects include:

### Nebraska's Intimate Partner & Sexual Violence Response Community: A Needs Assessment Concerning Allocation of American Rescue Plan Resources (forthcoming 2023)

As a component of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Nebraska was granted nearly $3.7 million in supplemental funding directed at improving our community’s ability to serve survivors of intimate partner & sexual violence. This project sought to evaluate the current landscape of Nebraska’s intimate partner & sexual violence response community to inform decision-making surrounding the allocation of these funds.

### Nebraska Intimate Partner & Sexual Violence Survey
Launched in 2020, the Nebraska Statewide Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (SIPSVS) is the first-ever
large-scale survey to assess sexual and intimate partner violence victimization among Nebraskans. 1,896 Nebraskan adults completed the survey & responses were weighted with regard to target demographics. 

### Who is Not Served?: Barriers to Helpseeking for Sexual Violence Survivors in Rural Nebraska

This project investigated the extent to which Nebraska survivors of sexual violence seek out services from domestic violence and sexual assault (DVSA) programs serving rural communities as well as the factors surrounding survivors’ decisions to seek out help.


### Omaha's Sexual Assault Kit Initiative


The Sexual Assault Kit Initiative (SAKI) is a federal grant program that aims to address the high number of untested sexual assault kits in law enforcement custody. As part of this initiative, the City of Omaha was awarded SAKI funding to implement these goals locally. As part of my role with this project, I lead analysis efforts concerning SAKI inventory data, contributing to annual reports, grant reporting, and the Omaha SAKI website.


### PAVE

PAVE is a platform that facilitates best practices and creates a single screening, assessment, and referral process for victims of trafficking. Currently, Nebraska's Department of Health & Human Services utilizes PAVE as its primary trafficking response tool. As part of my role with HTI Labs, I lead efforts behind the analysis of PAVE-generated data and community implementation efforts. 

### State of Domestic Violence in Douglas County, Nebraska 

In collaboration with the Women's Fund of Omaha, I provide ongoing data analysis covering trends in system response to intimate partner violence in Douglas County, Nebraska. This project leverages criminal justice data,  civil court data, and scraped data from public domains. This project is 5+ years in the making and has culminated in many deliverables.
